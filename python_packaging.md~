The build backend converts source files into a Wheel package.

Wheel (.whl) is a ZIP-format with a specific file name, based on
various PEP standards, and is what the end-user will download and
install. The files will only need to be moved to a location on the
target system; this is known as a built distribution, as oppose to a
source distribution which may require building/compiling.
